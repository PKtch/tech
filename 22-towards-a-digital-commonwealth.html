In order to be clear, <strong>t</strong>his paper uses the term<strong> “Automated Decision Making” (ADM) instead of “Artificial Intelligence” (“AI”)</strong>, because the use of this concept helps much better to clearly set out the issue: how are those automated decisions made? And who decides how they are made? We see today how the expansion of information technology has not been accompanied by expanded democratic control, resulting in a massive concentration of power and surveillance capabilities in a few hands, and little accountability or oversight by the public.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Artificial intelligence is, today, often neither artificial — its “magic” veneer obscures the all-too-human labour and decisions that shape its development — nor intelligent, as it reflects a blinkered set of powerful interests over all others. Instead of opening our eyes to new possibilities of a free and equal society, ADM is used to consolidate existing hierarchies and explore new mechanisms of control. </span></p><h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Need for a New Paradigm</strong></span></h3><p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is time for a new paradigm of the digital economy. A paradigm through which we establish new forms of ownership and governance of data and digital technologies, guided by democratic principles. A paradigm that unleashes the power of data and digital technologies for the common good and that helps to usher in an innovative, democratic, socially just and ecological transformation of our societies and economies. Moving towards such a digital commonwealth in which we will collectively benefit from the digital transformation will help us create a mixed and democratic economy. It will help us gain more democratic rights and to become free and sovereign in our technological choices, as individuals and societies.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">For DiEM25, citizens in a digital commonwealth</span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span class="s1">know, and can exercise, their clearly defined <strong>rights</strong><i> </i>as data subjects;</span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">democratically <strong>govern </strong>the use of data, setting its scope for private purposes, and harnessing its power for the public good;</span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">have recourse to <strong>institutional</strong><i> </i>means of enforcing their rights, such as independent, public data audits; and</span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">can democratically counter imbalances in <strong>economic</strong> power through alternative business models such as platform cooperatives.</span></li></ul><footer><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://pktch.github.io/tech/authors/diem25-tech-collective/" title="DiEM25 Tech Collective">DiEM25 Tech Collective</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/scripts.js?v=8d8da74413bdb3c2b8a987207ce19d2f"></script></body></html>
