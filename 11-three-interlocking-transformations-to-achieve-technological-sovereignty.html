They are set out in much more detail in the following chapters. We try to define the issues, and provide short, medium and long term solutions, based on two processes: <strong>Regulation </strong>and <strong>Renewal</strong>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Regulation means that, as a society, we take a collective responsibility to shape how technological actors should act or not act. We are not afraid to use the state (at all its levels, from the local authority to the EU) for its appropriate role of regulator, enabling and driving innovation and ensuring that not only costs, but also benefits, are shared across society. In addition, we also aim to include alternative ways of organising aspects of society such as the principle of the commons.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Renewal means that we need to innovate in the way technology and society interact. And we need to establish the conditions for social innovation and democratic societal transformation.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first way is the establishment of a <strong>Digital Commonwealth</strong> in Europe. This includes:</span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Countering the power of platform monopolies by</span><ul class="ul1"><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Strengthening regulations on Data Protection (GDPR) and ePrivacy to limit involuntary data extraction;</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Enforcing mandatory cross-platform-interoperability and Portability of Data;</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Ensuring stronger EU antitrust laws and better enforcement; and</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Introducing the concept of Data Unions for collective representation.</span></li></ul></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Building the infrastructure for a digital commonwealth by:</span><ul class="ul1"><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Opening up and democratising algorithmic Automated Decision Making (often wrongly denoted as “artificial intelligence (AI)”) processes;</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Decommodifying data through the establishment of a public data commons;</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Creating a framework of digital rights for citizens; and</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Supporting alternative business models to democratise economic structures, such as platform cooperatives.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second way is for Europe to <strong>democratise innovation </strong>and ensure that knowledge is shared in such a way as to benefit as many as possible.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This includes:</span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Reducing or abolishing monopolistic approaches to innovation, in particular around Intellectual Property; and</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Ensuring that the benefits of investment in innovation are available to as many as possible, and reverse the trend of <strong>socialising costs</strong> while <strong>privatising benefits</strong> of innovation.</span></li></ul><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Third, Europe must <strong>democratise the governance of innovation</strong> and technologies. New institutions and organisational forms in politics and the economy must be envisioned and put into practice. Digital technologies can help us build these.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This includes:</span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Opening up and democratising the processes by which technological development is funded, prioritised and decided; and</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Using technology to enable democratisation of decision-making processes at every level, especially to foster economic democracy.</span></li></ul><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The democratisation of technology is possible, and necessary. <strong>Technologies are never inevitable</strong>. They are always based on choices, values and social power. We can make different choices, argue for different values and change the societal processes and powers that shape technologies. Technologies that, in return, shape society, and us.</span></p><footer><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://pktch.github.io/tech/authors/diem25-tech-collective/" title="DiEM25 Tech Collective">DiEM25 Tech Collective</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/scripts.js?v=8d8da74413bdb3c2b8a987207ce19d2f"></script></body></html>
