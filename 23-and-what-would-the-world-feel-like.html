He lives in an urban area and receives electricity from a cooperative of electricity prosumers – people who produce electricity at home. The cooperative largely depends on data provided by the members to optimise their distribution strategy. Paul has decided to share a roughly localised but anonymised dataset, where he shares his weekly schedule, vacations and business travels – and other data that helps the cooperative to plan ahead. He did that by choosing a smart-rule on his reliable and easy-to-use home data storage. Paul feels good about being able to choose how and with whom he shares his personal data. He can do so with the certainty that legislation and data protection authorities will safeguard and enforce his rights.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paul also shares his data with many other cooperatives and municipal services. For instance, he shares photos of his delicious vegan cuisine on his social-networking node, so everyone who follows him on various public and private social networks – via the open-standard-protocol – can see his content. However, Paul has restricted the usage of his content for advertising purposes to local home delivery and city-guide cooperatives, of which Paul is a member.</span></p><footer><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://pktch.github.io/tech/authors/diem25-tech-collective/" title="DiEM25 Tech Collective">DiEM25 Tech Collective</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/scripts.js?v=8d8da74413bdb3c2b8a987207ce19d2f"></script></body></html>
