This means that any preferential tax treatment of royalties or other income (rent) deriving from IP, such as lower tax rates or higher exemptions on such income, must immediately be withdrawn. They should be replaced by the opposite: income from IP (rent) must be taxed preferably at higher rates, and more progressively, than income from selling actual goods or services.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, the draft EU Copyright Directive must be fundamentally reviewed, in order to obtain much more balanced rights of users, re-users, creators and innovators. A European "<strong>fair use</strong>" concept must be created, with broad applications, and based on the fundamental<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>principle of freedom of speech.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Introduce a general principle of IP release: any IP belonging to a legal entity which either goes bankrupt, is liquidated or otherwise ceases to function, must be released into the public domain. Equally, any IP ceases to be valid on the death of the inventor/creator.</span></p><footer><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://pktch.github.io/tech/authors/diem25-tech-collective/" title="DiEM25 Tech Collective">DiEM25 Tech Collective</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/scripts.js?v=8d8da74413bdb3c2b8a987207ce19d2f"></script></body></html>
