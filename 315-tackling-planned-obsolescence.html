In line with our ecological goals we want products that are durable, repairable and/or upgradeable. In practice, this means the following:</span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Consumers should have the option to have their devices repaired by an independent party. Any documentation or product guarantees that prohibit this should be banned.</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">As a general rule, all spare parts should be replaceable, and available on the market. If the original manufacturer no longer provides such spare parts, they cannot block anyone else from providing them.</span></li></ul><footer><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://pktch.github.io/tech/plannedobsolescence/">PlannedObsolescence</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://pktch.github.io/tech/authors/diem25-tech-collective/" title="DiEM25 Tech Collective">DiEM25 Tech Collective</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://pktch.github.io/tech/assets/js/scripts.js?v=8d8da74413bdb3c2b8a987207ce19d2f"></script></body></html>
